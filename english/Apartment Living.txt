Roger: Hello?

Ann: Hello Roger? This is Ann.

Roger: Oh hi, Ann. How have you been? And how’s your new apartment working out?

Ann: Well, that’s what I’m calling about. You see, I’ve decided to look for a new place.

Roger: Oh, what’s the problem with your place now? I thought you liked the apartment.

Ann: Oh, I do, but it’s a little far from campus, and the commute is just killing me. Do you think you could help? I thought you might know more about the housing situation near the school.

Roger: Okay, what’s your budget like? I mean, how much do you want to spend on rent?

Ann: Uh, somewhere under $200 a month, including utilities, if I could. Oh, and I’d prefer to rent a furnished apartment.

Roger: Hmm. And anything else?

Ann: Yeah, I need a parking space.

Roger: Well, I know there’s an apartment complex around the corner that seems to have a few vacancies. I’ll drop by there on my way to class today.

Ann: Hey, thanks a lot.

Roger: No problem.
