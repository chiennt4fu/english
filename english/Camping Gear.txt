*** Camping Gear ***




Paul: Sara, I’ve been looking forward to our yearly campout for three weeks. [Me too.] It’s going to be a wonderful day for hiking tomorrow. The great outdoors. Camping under the stars. This is the life.

Sara: Yeah, but Paul, I’m a little bit worried about the weather though. The weatherman said it was going to rain later tonight.

Paul: Ah, nonsense. Nothing can spoil our adventure. Those weather reports are never right.

Sara: And it said there was a chance of high winds.

Paul: Ah. Don’t worry.

[Thunder]

Sara: Paul. Paul. Did you remember to bring our raincoats just in case, like I told you?

[Light rain]

Paul: Oh, no. I left them on the front porch.

[Heavy rain]

Sara: Hmm. What are we going to do now?

Paul: We’ll have to sleep in the car! Hurry get in!

[Door shut]

Sara: So, Paul, what are we going to do now?

Paul: Uh, how about playing a card game?

Sara: Uhh. I left them next to the picnic table. [ Aww] Hey, you don’t want me to go out in the rain and get them, do you?

Paul: Nah. That’s okay. So what now?

Sara: Well, we could head down the mountain and stay at that hotel we passed on the way up, or go home.

Paul: Hmm, why don’t we just make the best of it here and hope the weather clears.

Sara: That’s a good idea.
